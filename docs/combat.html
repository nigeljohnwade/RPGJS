            <h1>Combat Object</h1>
            <p>
                The combat object is used to perform (unsurprisingly) combat actions between characters and &lsquo;monsters&rsquo;.
                The combat system is abstracted into attack functions, for each attack type, which create a number of hits,
                an inflict damage function which calculates how much damage is inflicted by the instigator and a recieve
                damage function which calculates how much of that the retaliator recieves.
