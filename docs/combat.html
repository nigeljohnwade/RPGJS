            <h1>Combat Object</h1>
            <p>
                The combat object is used to perform (unsurprisingly) combat actions between characters and non-player-characters and &lsquo;monsters&rsquo;.
                The combat system consists of attack functions, one for each attack type, each of which create a number of hits.
                An inflict damage function calculates how much damage is inflicted by the instigator.
                A recieve damage function calculates how much of that the retaliator recieves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the attack functions generates a base 50/50 chance of creating a hit, one chance per attack statistic.
                E.g. a melee attack with a melee attribute of 4 generates 4 &times; 50/50 chances of hitting.
                Each of these 50/50 chances is further modified by other factors including status effects, weapon bonuses etc.
                Each successful attack is passed to the damage calculation function (?without regard to how much the chance was made by?)
                which uses the number of hits and any damage modifiers from status effects, weapon bonuses etc. to calculate teh damage inflicted.
                This damage inflicted and the number of hits are passed to the receive damage function where it is determined how much
                of this damage is received by the retaliator based upon thier toughness and any other modifiers such as status effects
                and armour modifiers.
            </p>
            <p>As a rough guide evenly matched attack and toghness statistics pitted against each other should be eveny matched.</p>
